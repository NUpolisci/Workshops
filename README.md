# Workshops
This repository is a clearing house for resources for individual workshops held at the Politcal Science Department at Northwestern University. These workshops are taught using R. 

# Software
For workshops, it's best to install [R and RStudio] (https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/r-and-rstudio/) on your own laptop (both are free). If you can't install these programs or run into issues installing packages, [RStudio Cloud] (https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/r-and-rstudio/#option-2-rstudio-cloud) is a good option.
