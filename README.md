# Workshops
This repository is a clearing house for resources for individual workshops held at the Politcal Science Department at Northwestern University. These workshops are taught using R. For information about how to access the files, see this guide [here](https://github.com/NUpolisci/How-to-use-Github-repositories-for-workshops).

# Software
For workshops, it's best to install [R and RStudio] (https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/r-and-rstudio/) on your own laptop (both are free). If you can't install these programs or run into issues installing packages, [RStudio Cloud] (https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/r-and-rstudio/#option-2-rstudio-cloud) is a good option. 

# Resources 
A list of various resources to help you along your R journey.

## Github 
If you want to learn more about how to use Github, visit the repository [Here](https://github.com/NUpolisci/How-to-Pull-Push-Merge).

## Research Consulting Services
For additional resources in R, look on the [NUIT Research Consulting Services](https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/) page, which include many useful blog posts on solving many common problems in R (as well as other programming languages).

## Handouts
[RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are short pdfs that summarize key R functions on specific topics. Many people print them out for reference while working in R. The `ggplot` cheat sheet, in particular, in indispensable.

## Books 
[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a wonderful and ***FREE*** resources!

## Online Forums 
There are a number of online forums in which people have more than likely asked a question nearly identical to the question you have. Some include [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/), or [QuickR](https://www.statmethods.net/)
